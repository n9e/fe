      tip: `The tags here refer to the tags of alert events, which filter alert events through the following tag matching rules. Multiple matching operators are supported, explained as follows:

- \`==\` matches a specific tag value, can only fill in one. If you want to match multiple values at the same time, you should use the \`in\` operator
- \`=~\` fills in a regular expression to flexibly match tag values
- \`in\` matches multiple tag values, similar to the \`in\` operation in SQL
- \`not in\` does not match tag values, can fill in multiple values, similar to the \`not in\` operation in SQL, used to exclude multiple tag values
- \`!=\` not equal, used to exclude a specific tag value
- \`!~\` does not match the regular expression, fill in a regular expression, and tag values that match this regular expression will be excluded, similar to \`!~\` in PromQL`,
