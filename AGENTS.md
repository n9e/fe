# Codex Instructions

- After making code changes, do not run `npm run build` or `npx tsc` unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- If verification is useful, prefer lighter checks that are relevant to the changed files, or ask before running expensive project-wide commands.
- Prefer native type-checking APIs over lodash for type narrowing: use `Array.isArray` instead of `_.isArray`, `typeof x === 'number'` instead of `_.isNumber`, `x == null` instead of `_.isNil`, etc. Lodash type guard functions are not recognized by TypeScript when `@types/lodash` is unavailable, leaving `unknown` types un-narrowed.

## Forms and temporary containers

- When closing temporary containers such as modals and drawers, explicitly reset form data and local state (for example, `form.resetFields()`, loading state, and temporary selections) to prevent stale values when reopening.
- `form.setFieldsValue` performs an incremental update. When editing a different entity or fully repopulating a form, call `form.resetFields()` before `form.setFieldsValue()`.
- Ant Design `Collapse.Panel` does not mount its content while initially collapsed. When a panel contains `Form.Item` or `Form.List` fields that must be validated, populated, or submitted, add `forceRender` so the fields register with the form. Purely presentational panel content does not need it.
